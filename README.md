A BORING DYSTOPIA
=================
"A Boring Dystopia" is a Python-based COYA written by Daniel Matheis.
CYOA stands for Choose Your Own Adventure - Gamebooks popular in the 80s and 90s.
Instead of a linear story the user is in control of where to go and what to do next.
With Python there are many more possibilities than with a book, dice, pencil and rubber.

First though Nodes with their Text and possible Choices with their Texts, Destination Nodes and Outcomes have to be connected to make it all work. Here a first try to make writing a somewhat complex CYOA more elegant and fun.
